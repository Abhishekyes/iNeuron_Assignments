1. What exactly is []?
Answere: it a square bracket.use itrables of list.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello'as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a','b','c','d'] for the next three queries.
Answere: spam.insert(2,'hello')
        third value = 2nd index if it start with zero.

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Answere: 3

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Answere: spam =['a','b','c','d']
        output: 'd'
        
5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14,'cat',11,'cat', True] for the next three questions.
Answere: spam =['a','b','c','d']
         output: ['a','b','c']
         

6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Answere: bacon = [3.14,'cat',11,'cat', True]
        output: 1
        
7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Answere: bacon =[3.14,'cat',11,'cat', True]
         output: [3.14,'cat',11,'cat', True,99]
        
8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Answere:[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Answere: x = [2,5,6]

         list concatenation : 'sapm' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam' 
         list replication operators: 'spam' * 3 = 'spamspamspam'

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Answere: append(): it can insert element at the end of list.
         insert():insert can use if we insert element by the help of index.
         
11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Answere: remove(),delete().

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Answere: list value : its is contain diffrent data types like string,integer float ,complexnumber etc.
         string value: it can be use in single or double quotes only its the sequence of character.

13. What is the difference between tuples and lists?
Answere : tuples: use (), it contain unique value,it's immutable(it cant change).
          lists: use [],it conatin duplicate valueit is mutable.
          
14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Answere: (42,)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Answere:using typecast
        x = [2,5,8,6]   its a list change in tuple
    ex1: y = tuple(x) 
         y = (2,5,8,6)   its convert into tuple now change in list 
    ex2: z = list(y) 
        now z  = [2,5,8,6] its a list now

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Answere:

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Answere: shallowcopy: copy.copy() its a syntax when we perform any change in shallow copy than the change will also perform on orignal.
         deepcopy: copy.deepcopy() its a syntax when we perform any change in deep copy than the change will not effect on orignal.
